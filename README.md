**Sometime in the future, you might be able to view my github profile's readme via something like webarchive. Right now, I think I might need to find sometime to put a slightly more professional email within my github's profile introduction.**

- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chew Lik Hern or you may also recognize me as IT Chew from my youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@itchew6357), some may recognize me from this channel of mine on Bilibili(https://space.bilibili.com/628663470).
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of cybersecurity approaches which will still have their security effects even after data leakage/breaches.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something related on cryptography.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any decentralization technology and technologies which help user to regain control over their own data.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach me on linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lik-hern-chew-437403195/) or via my protonmail (it_chew@protonmail.com) or via Session Messenger which uses TOR deepweb, decentralization and deidentitified (05573054e242144d0df881e763d4806d9eee207a81900d790d49401b5bd2f44c36).
- 🔐 If you are contacting me via LinkedIn or email and you feel not secure, kindly uses libsodium or bouncycastle to generate 3 or 2 pairs of X25519 or X448 keypairs and 3 or 2 pairs of ED25519 or ED448 keypairs. Let's have a **hello** session and then let's use presumably E2EE for our communications. **To be even more secure/private, kindly have hello session when both of us are online to highly reduce potential MITM attacks.**
- 🌱 I’ll be developing some projects by using my spare time. Some of it may include CLI, digital signature as a passwordless authentication platform. However, for the time being.., perhaps I may need patreon to actually transform these into official community based projects.
