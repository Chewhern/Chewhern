- 👋 Hi, I’m @Chew Lik Hern
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of cybersecurity approaches which will still have their security effects even after data leakage/breaches.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning something related on cryptography.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any decentralization technology and technologies which help user to regain control over their own data.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can reach me on linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/lik-hern-chew-437403195/) or via my email which is not that official (chrono_legionnaire@protonmail.com) to be used in actual job seeking.
- 🌱 I’ll be developing some projects by using my spare time. Some of it may include CLI, digital signature as a passwordless authentication platform. However, for the time being.., perhaps I may need patreon to actually transform these into official community based projects.
